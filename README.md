I have prepared a React Mobile responsive Project styled completely with Tailwind CSS.
Here,I have designed my website layout using flexbox and grid-layouts. I have created a data.js file which pulls all the data and images which simulates an API response.
We can filter our food items on the basis of their category(burger,pizza,indian,dessert,all) and type(veg,non-veg). You can also filter them on the basis of their price which is classified in four types:(0-100,101-200,201-300,301-500). This filter is done using the javascript filter array method.
